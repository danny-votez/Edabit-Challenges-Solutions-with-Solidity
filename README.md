### *Edabit* Challenges Solutions with Solidity
##### Overview
- **[Edabit Inc.](https://edabit.com/)** offers an opportunity to learn to code with 10000+ interactive challenges.
- Of the different languages that **[Edabit](https://edabit.com)** offers on its platform are:

     > **C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift**
- This repository focuses on **[Solidity]()** and contains Solidity solutions to **some** of the **Edabit** Challenges
- **[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)** is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum

According to **[soliditylang.org](), Solidity:**:
> - Is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
> - Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
> - Is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
> - Is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
> - With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets
