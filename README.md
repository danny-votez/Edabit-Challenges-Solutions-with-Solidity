#### Preamble to Solidity

***From [soliditylang.org]()***
- Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum

***Solidity***
> - Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
> - Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
> - Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
> - Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
> - With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets
